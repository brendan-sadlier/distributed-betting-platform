To get the logs of a pod run: kubectl logs <pod-name>

To delete a service run: kubectl delete service <service-name>

To delete a pod run: kubectl delete pod <pod-name>

To delete all services run: kubectl delete services --all

If you change the code and want to update the service, you need to build the image and push it to docker hub,

docker build -t brendansadlier/<image-name>:<tag> .

e.g. docker build -t brendansadlier/blt-bookie:latest .

docker push brendansadlier/<image-name>:<tag>

e.g. docker push brendansadlier/blt-bookie:latest

and then run the following command: kubectl apply -f k8s/
